# Car Dealership

## Description of the Project

The Car Dealership application allows users to explore a filtering system, which takes information parsed from a .csv file, and prints out lists of cars in a clean format. Users can also add a new car to the file, or remove a car from the file.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to Search for cars under different filter criteria, so that I can find the specific car I want.
- As a developer, I want to have the main code read from and write to a file, so that I can add or remove cars from a running tab.
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate the menus in a clean and friendly way, so that I can have a good user experience.
- As a user, I want to have the presentation of the program to be pretty AND functional, so I can easily understand what I'm looking at.
